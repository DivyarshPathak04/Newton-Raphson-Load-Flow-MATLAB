# Newton–Raphson Load Flow Analysis (MATLAB)

## Overview
This project implements the Newton–Raphson method for load flow analysis of a 3-bus power system using MATLAB.

## Features
- Newton–Raphson load flow algorithm
- Voltage magnitude and phase angle calculation
- Voltage profile plot
- Convergence characteristic plot

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Power System Analysis
- Numerical Methods

## Results
The algorithm converges in few iterations due to quadratic convergence property of NR method.
